What a journey
spent 3 hours trying to figure out why I could not pass state to a function
beware of setting state in constructure as this.setState({bleh:""}) because it is set in constructor. 
when a function calls this.state...I will get an error, state of bleh is empty!
so insted we do this.state={bleh:""} now its mutable
